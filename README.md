This is an implementation on python of the spike detection and sorting algorythm presented in [this paper:](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2015.00452/full#h8)

Using Quian Quirogas dataset you can compare different windows sizes and steps to get better clusters

Also, KampffLab provides high density electrodes data openly and freely:

Still my clustering sucks ass, but may be betterify the clustering...also...spikes suck.

If I where to use the Dw(1-Nyq) as features, shouldn't that be an amazing space for pca? Let's try that...complicate yourselves, that's the last thought.

Also, lastThough has a new idea on how to do analyze raw electrode data, and maybe an interesting insight
