This is an implementation on python of the spike detection and sorting algorythm presented in [this](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2015.00452/full#h8)

Using Quian Quirogas dataset you can compare different windows sizes and steps to get better clusters

Still my clustering sucks ass, but may be betterify the clustering...also...

If I where to use the Dw(1-20) as features, shouldn't that be an amazing space for pca? LEt's try that...complicate yourselfe, MF.

Mucha Suerte!
